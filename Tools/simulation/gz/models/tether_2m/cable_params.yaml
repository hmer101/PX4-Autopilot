# Note: 0.0001 - too unstable to even take off at speed. 
# 0.0005 - damping visually clearly too low on takeoff engage




# For single damping:
# 0.003 - too small? Goes unstable at 0.0019, and 0.001. Works with max step size 0.0005, but looks too underdamped
# 0.004 - Works with 0.0019
# 0.005 - seems ok, might be too large still
# 0.0075 - too large (works with 0.004 step size though, kind of)
